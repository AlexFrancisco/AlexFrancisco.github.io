<body><h2>About Me</h2><p>Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Francisco. I'm a stroke survivor and unfortunately, I cannot hike anymore. I was born in '82 and live in the 4-corners region of the southwest. This site is fully AI-powered, and I am passionate about leveraging technology to create innovative solutions. With a background in computer science and a love for coding, I enjoy exploring the intersection of AI, machine learning, and web development. I'm also interested in digital art and hope to start showcasing my own soon. Join me on this journey of exploration and discovery!</p></body>
