                <h3>A New Chapter: From Stroke Recovery to AI Innovation</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2023, following a life-altering stroke, I discovered AI's transformative potential not just as a technology, but as an assistive tool that became essential to my recovery. Having lost use of my left hand, I could no longer code traditionally. This forced me to adapt by using speech-to-text dictation combined with AI assistance—and remarkably, it made me a better developer. While I might not be able to type as fast as before, I can definitely write code, correspondence, and communicate with peers far more effectively than ever. This experience revealed accessibility gaps that technology could bridge, and sparked a deep commitment to building solutions that help others. My recovery journey continues today—always recovering, always working—and this ongoing experience keeps me grounded in building technology that truly serves real human needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What began as a personal necessity evolved into a mission: understanding how AI systems work, their capabilities and limitations, and most importantly, how they can be leveraged to make the world more accessible and efficient—both for individuals facing challenges and enterprises seeking transformation. Today, I bring 20+ years of enterprise technology experience and firsthand knowledge of AI as assistive technology to businesses in the Four Corners region and remotely across the country, building solutions that are both technically robust and genuinely human-centered.

                        <p>Following stroke, lost use of left hand which made traditional coding impossible. Adapted by using speech-to-text dictation combined with AI assistance (ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools), which not only compensated for the physical limitation but actually improved coding quality, correspondence, and peer communication. While typing speed decreased, the ability to write better code faster increased significantly. Profound recognition of AI's potential to bridge accessibility gaps, transform human-computer interaction, and serve as an equalizing force for those facing physical or cognitive challenges. This firsthand experience became the foundation for building technology that truly serves human needs.</p>
