                <p>
                    My training approach is rooted in real-world application, not academic theory. Having used AI daily to overcome physical limitations and enhance my development capabilities, I understand both the transformative potential and practical challenges of AI adoption. I don't just teach what AI can do—I show you how to integrate it into your actual workflows, measure results, and build sustainable AI practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you're a leadership team evaluating AI strategy, technical staff learning to implement AI tools, or an operations manager identifying automation opportunities, my sessions are customized to your industry, technical level, and specific business challenges. No generic slide decks—just practical, actionable knowledge you can use immediately.

                <p>
                    All training sessions are currently delivered virtually via video conference, allowing me to serve clients anywhere in the United States. Interactive presentations include screen sharing for hands-on demonstrations, breakout sessions for team activities, and collaborative tools for real-time engagement.

                    Virtual delivery offers flexibility, eliminates travel costs, and makes it easy to record sessions for team members who couldn't attend live. I use industry-standard platforms (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) based on your organization's preferences.
